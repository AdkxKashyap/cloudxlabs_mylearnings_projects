    "\n",
    "## What is This Project About?\n",
    "\n",
    "We're building a **classification model** to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not, based on their characteristics:\n",
    "- **Features:** Passenger class, Sex, Age, Number of siblings/spouses, Number of parents/children, Fare paid, Port of embarkation\n",
    "- **Target:** Survived (1) or Did Not Survive (0)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **binary classification problem** (two outcomes: yes or no).\n",

    "\n",
    "### How SVC Works\n",
    "\n",
    "SVC finds the **best decision boundary** that separates \"Survived\" from \"Did Not Survive\" passengers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Think of it like drawing a line on a map:**\n",
    "- One side of the line = Survived (1)\n",
    "- Other side of the line = Did Not Survive (0)\n",
    "- The goal: Maximize the distance between the line and the data points\n",
    "\n",
    "### RBF Kernel — Handling Complex Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "SVC(gamma=\"auto\", random_state=42)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kernel:** Determines how SVC draws the decision boundary\n",
    "- **Linear Kernel:** Straight line (for linearly separable data)\n",
    "- **RBF (Radial Basis Function) Kernel:** Curved, complex boundaries (for non-linear patterns)\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **RBF** because survival data is complex — a straight line won't separate \"survived\" from \"did not survive\" well enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Linear Kernel (simple)     RBF Kernel (complex)\n",
    "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━     ╱╲╱╲╱╲╱╲╱╲╱╲\n",

    "\n",
    "### Gamma Parameter — How \"Local\" the Decision is\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gamma = \"auto\"** means sklearn automatically calculates it as `1 / (n_features)`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gamma controls:** How far the influence of each training example reaches\n",
    "- **Low Gamma (≤ 0.01):** Each example has **far-reaching influence** → Simple, smooth boundaries → Might underfit\n",
    "- **High Gamma (≥ 0.1):** Each example has **local influence only** → Complex, wiggly boundaries → Might overfit\n",

    "## Model 2: Random Forest Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Random Forest Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forest = \"Forest\" of Decision Trees**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of one tree, we grow **100 decision trees** (n_estimators=100), each trained on a **random subset** of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it makes predictions:**\n",
    "1. Each tree makes its own prediction (Survived or Did Not Survive)\n",
    "2. **Vote:** All 100 trees vote\n",
    "3. **Winner:** Prediction with the most votes wins\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example with 3 trees:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Tree 1 says: \"Survived\"  ✓\n",
    "Tree 2 says: \"Survived\"  ✓\n",
    "Tree 3 says: \"Did Not\"   ✗\n",
    "            ───────\n",

    "**Random Forest performs better!** 🎉\n",

    "**Why?** The Titanic dataset has complex relationships:\n",
    "- Women had higher survival rates\n",
    "- Higher passenger class → Higher survival rates\n",
    "- Age mattered (children vs. adults)\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SVC with RBF kernel** is powerful but requires careful tuning (gamma, C parameters)\n",
    "2. **Random Forest** is more flexible and often works better with real-world, messy data\n",
    "3. **Cross-validation** gives us honest performance estimates (not overly optimistic)\n",
    "4. **Feature engineering** (preprocessing pipelines) is crucial for both models\n",
